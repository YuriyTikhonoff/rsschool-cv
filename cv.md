Hi! I'm a freshman in **Web Development** and in **JavaScript** particularly. And I'm so excited of presence so many cool and cutting edge tools for creating applications of any design and complexity that I made a decision to be strongly committed to switching to a profession of software developer and contribute to projects intended to make the world a better place and be able to turn my all brave ideas into reality.

I perceive the realm of software development as some kind of combination of Math methods with pure Art and creativity allows people to facilitate a lot of mundane activities and provide new services of a totally new quality of interactions and efficiency.

That's why I find all difficulties and hardships of the learning process worth obtaining skill of a mighty wizard capable of conveying to people all advantages of digital applications through mighty knowledge and expertise.


## Skills

In my projects I use **HTML5** and **CSS3**, framework **Bootstrap**, pretty skilled in pure **JavaScript** and core **PHP** as well as **Laravel** and **REACT** and **NODE**. I have an experience of making layouts from provided mockups in **Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch**, working with CMS **WordPress**, and creating **Single Page Applications**.

My higly developed **soft skills** allows me to be a cooperative team player, keep thinking out the box, persistenly improve my knowledge and performance level and overdeliver expected results of my work. I am deeply convinced that grit and perseverance are the cornerstones of mastering in any area.

## Code examples
> let symbolsCount = str => {  
return str.split('').reduce((result, symbol) => {  
let resultClone = {...result};  
if (!resultClone[symbol]) {  
resultClone[symbol] = 1;  
} else {  
resultClone[symbol] = ++resultClone[symbol];  
}  
 return resultClone;  
}, {});  
};

> // // Pro  
// const processArray = (arr, callback) => [arr.map](http://arr.map/)(item => callback(item));  
  // Simple  
function processArray(arr, callback) {  
let result = [];  
for(let number of arr) {  
result.push(callback(number));  
 }  
return result;  
}
